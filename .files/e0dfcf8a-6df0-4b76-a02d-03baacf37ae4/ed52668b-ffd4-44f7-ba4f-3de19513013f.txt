• Has the organization conducted backup recovery testing to ensure that critical data can be recovered using existing data backups?  
• Does the backup recovery testing verify the ability to recover d ata and operations based on identified testing 
scenarios using actual tests (i.e., not tabletop exercises)?  
• Can testing be done during normal business hours or must it take place during off hours?  
• Have the tests included personnel with contingency
