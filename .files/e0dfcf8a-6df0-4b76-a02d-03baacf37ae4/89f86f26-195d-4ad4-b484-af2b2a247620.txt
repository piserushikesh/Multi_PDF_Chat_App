6. Determine the level of risk. The regulated entity assesses the level of risk to ePHI  while  
considering the information gathered and determinations made during the previous 
steps. The level of risk is determined by analyzing the values assigned to the overall 
likelihood of threat occurrence (i.e., Step 4) and the resulting impact of threat 
occurrence (i.e., Step 5). Table 6 and Table 7 show examples of risk -level matrices that  
can assist in determining risk levels for each threat event/vulnerability pair. Regulated 
entities can use a different risk matrix that aligns with the ratings scales used for likelihood and impact in Steps 4 and 5.  NIST SP 800 -66r2   Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule
